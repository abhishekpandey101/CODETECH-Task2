BMI Calculator App - Overview
Project Description
The BMI Calculator App is an Android application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height, using either the metric or imperial measurement system. The app is designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing, incorporating modern Android development practices like declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.

Features
Splash Screen:

The app features a splash screen with an animated delay of 3 seconds. During this time, an icon and the app name are displayed. After the delay, the main functionality of the app is revealed.
Unit Selection:

Users can choose between Metric or Imperial units for their input:
Metric: Weight in kilograms (kg) and height in centimeters (cm).
Imperial: Weight in pounds (lbs) and height in feet and inches.
BMI Calculation:

The app calculates BMI based on user input:
For Metric units, BMI is calculated as weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)).
For Imperial units, the weight is first converted from pounds to kilograms and the height from feet and inches to centimeters before calculating BMI using the same formula.
Obesity Level Display:

After calculating BMI, the app displays the corresponding obesity level, which categorizes BMI as:
Underweight
Normal weight
Overweight
Obese (Class I, II, III)
Responsive Layout:

The app layout is fully responsive, adjusting smoothly across different screen sizes and orientations. The UI is created using Jetpack Compose, making it declarative and reactive to state changes.
Code Overview
MainActivity:

Handles the main lifecycle of the app, including the initialization of the splash screen and the main app interface.
Uses remember and LaunchedEffect for managing state and delaying transitions from splash screen to the main content.
SplashScreen:

A composable function displaying the app's icon and name. It fills the entire screen using a Box layout, centered both horizontally and vertically.
BmiCalculatorApp:

This is the core composable that manages user input and BMI calculation. It provides UI elements for:
Unit selection (Metric or Imperial)
Weight input and Height input fields
BMI calculation button
Displaying BMI result and obesity level
UnitSelection:

A composable that allows the user to toggle between Metric and Imperial units using radio buttons.
BMI Calculation Logic:

calculateBMI(): This function computes the BMI based on the user's input and the selected measurement system (Metric or Imperial).
getObesityLevel(): This function takes the BMI result and returns a string indicating the user’s obesity category (Underweight, Normal weight, etc.).
Future Enhancements
Error Handling: Add more robust input validation, ensuring users provide valid numeric input before calculating BMI.
User Preferences: Store the user’s last selected unit (Metric/Imperial) and input values using SharedPreferences or Jetpack DataStore.
UI Enhancements: Improve visual appeal by incorporating more advanced animations or design components from Material 3.
Tools and Technologies
Kotlin: The primary programming language used to build the app.
Jetpack Compose: A modern Android UI toolkit used to create the UI in a declarative way.
Material 3: The app uses Material Design components to create a visually appealing and consistent UI.
How to Run the Project
